# PayPalIpnWebFormsDemo
Simple working example of how to receive payment confirmation from PayPal's IPN feature

It's easy to send people from your website to PayPal to get paid, but if you need to know whether or not they actually paid,
you can use PayPal's IPN feature.  This project is a simple working example of how to receive confirmation from IPN.

Uses ASP.Net Web Forms. Years ago, I wrote about this in a blog post at http://jefftrotman.com/tag/paypal/. 
There's a little more explanation there. This version uses C# instead of Visual Basic and includes a SQL database file as
part of the project so you don't have to fool with the scripts. 

Information about IPN can be found on PayPal's developer website at
